  <h1>quote</h1>
<p>Someone will declare, “I am the leader!” and expect everyone to get in line and follow him or her to the gates of heaven or hell. My experience is that it doesn’t happen that way. Others follow you based on the quality of your actions rather than the magnitude of your declarations.” ―Bill Walsh</p>
<h3>quote 2</h3>
<p>. "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." —Calvin Coolidge</p>
<h5>quote 3</h5>
<p>“Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.” ―Maya Angelou</p>
